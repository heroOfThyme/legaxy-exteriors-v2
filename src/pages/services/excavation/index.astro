    items={[
      {
        title: 'How far in advance should I schedule excavation services?',
        description:
          "We recommend scheduling excavation work at least 2-3 weeks in advance for residential projects and 4-6 weeks for larger commercial jobs. During peak seasons (spring and summer), longer lead times may be necessary. For new construction projects, contact us as soon as your plans are finalized and permits are in process. We'll work with you to establish the ideal timeframe based on your project schedule and our availability. For emergency situations, we make every effort to accommodate urgent needs.",
      },
      {
        title: 'Do you handle the permit process for excavation work?',
        description:
          'Yes, we can assist with the permitting process for most excavation projects. Depending on your location and project scope, permits may be required for significant excavation work, especially when it involves structural foundations, significant grading changes, or work near property lines. Our team is familiar with local permitting requirements and can either handle the entire process on your behalf or work alongside your general contractor to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained before work begins.',
      },
      {
        title: 'How do you protect my property during excavation?',
        description:
          "Protecting your property is one of our top priorities. Before beginning work, we'll clearly mark access routes and work zones, install protective barriers around landscaping and structures that need to be preserved, and lay down plywood or mats to protect existing paved surfaces when necessary. We carefully monitor excavation near existing structures to prevent undermining foundations and use erosion control measures to contain soil and prevent runoff. Throughout the project, we maintain a clean job site and minimize dust and noise as much as possible.",
      },
      {
        title: 'What considerations are made for soil conditions and drainage?',
        description:
          'Every excavation project begins with an assessment of your soil conditions. We evaluate soil composition, stability, drainage characteristics, and compaction requirements for your specific project. Based on this assessment, we develop appropriate strategies for excavation, material management, and erosion control. For foundation work, we ensure proper base preparation with appropriate materials. For grading projects, we create slopes that direct water away from structures. When necessary, we can incorporate additional drainage solutions to address specific site challenges.',
      },
      {
        title: 'How deep can you excavate, and what size projects can you handle?',
        description:
          'Our equipment capabilities allow us to excavate to depths suitable for standard residential foundations (typically 4-8 feet) as well as deeper excavations for full basements, pools, and commercial foundations. For specialty deep excavation needs, we have partnerships with companies that specialize in those services. In terms of project size, we regularly handle everything from small residential projects like driveway preparations and drainage corrections to large-scale commercial site preparation and subdivision development. Our diverse equipment fleet allows us to scale our approach to match your specific project requirements.',
      },
      {
        title: 'What happens to the excavated soil and materials?',
        description:
          "The management of excavated materials depends on your project requirements and local regulations. In many cases, we can stockpile quality topsoil on-site for later use in final grading and landscaping. Excess fill material may be removed from the site and either repurposed on other projects or properly disposed of according to local requirements. When excavating contaminated soil or materials requiring special handling, we follow all applicable regulations for transportation and disposal. If you have specific preferences for material management, we'll work with you to develop an appropriate plan for your project.",
